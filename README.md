CDnow, Inc. was a dot-com company that operated an online shopping website selling compact discs and music-related products. In April 1998, during the dot-com bubble, the company was valued at over $1 billion ($1.74 billion in 2023). In July 2000, it was acquired by Bertelsmann Music Group for $117 million ($197 million in 2023); shortly thereafter Amazon was contracted to operate the website. At its peak, it employed over 750 people and had offices in Fort Washington, Pennsylvania, New York City, London, and Los Angeles.

In 2013 CDNow was completely taken offline.
